# Hangman_Game-Console_Base

*Welcome to the Console-based Hangman Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in C++ that runs in the console.*


<ins>**Overview**</ins>
-> Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret word letter by letter within a certain number of guesses. For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. If the hangman is fully drawn before the player guesses the word, the game ends, and the player loses.


<ins>**Gameplay**</ins>

-> The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
-> The player has a limited number of tries (incorrect guesses) to guess the word.
-> The player guesses one letter at a time.
-> If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word.
-> If the guessed letter is incorrect, part of the hangman is drawn.
-> The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before running out of tries.
-> The player loses if the hangman is fully drawn before guessing the word.


<ins>**Installation and Usage**</ins>

-> Clone the repository or download the source code.
-> Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
-> Run the executable file.
-> Follow the instructions on the console to play the game.


<ins>**How to Play?</ins>

-> Upon starting the game, a blank word with placeholders for each letter will be displayed.
-> Enter a letter to guess.
-> If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. Otherwise, part of the hangman will be drawn.
Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.


<ins> **Code Overview**</ins>

-> The game logic is implemented in a single C++ file.
-> The secret word is randomly selected from a predefined list.
-> The player's input is read from the console.
-> The hangman drawing is displayed based on the number of incorrect guesses.


<ins>**Dependencies**</ins>

This Hangman game has no external dependencies and can be compiled and run using any standard C++ compiler.
